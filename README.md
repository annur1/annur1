My ongoing project:
AI-based Fraud Detection System

Overview

This project implements an AI-based Fraud Detection System using Python. The system analyzes transaction data and uses machine learning techniques to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent. This system can help detect fraudulent activities in real-time, making it suitable for applications in banking, e-commerce, and other financial sectors.

Features

Transaction Data Analysis: Analyzes various transaction features such as amount, location, and time to detect suspicious patterns.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to classify transactions.

Real-Time Fraud Detection: Can be extended for real-time fraud detection with incoming transaction data.

Performance Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Data Visualization: Provides visual insights into model performance and fraud detection trends.

Technologies Used

Python: Primary programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

XGBoost: For advanced gradient boosting algorithm.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For visualizing data and model results.
